## Testing

Fuzz testing relies on actual keystrokes generated to effectively test a real-user's inputs. This means that if clicked off the window, random keystrokes will begin to affect the user's computer. For best usage, leave your computer alone for the two minuites the test is running, or close the window. Alttabbing while the program is running is not recommended
